Simulation of Central Limit Theorem in R Shiny

This simple R Shiny exercise tries to replicate the simulation in section 2.2 of the book "Introduction to Econometrics with R" (Hanck et al., 2020).

The plot shows the distribution of the means of *N* bernoulli distributed samples of size *n*. The data and the plot are updated every 1000ms with the chosen parameters.

By the CLT, the distribution of the sample means should look approximately normal as we increase sample size *n*.
